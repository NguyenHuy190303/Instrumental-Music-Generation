# Instrumental-Music-Generation
Music Generation is a task to build a system that generates music from an original audio sample or parameters, shown by projects like Magenta, AIVA, OpenAI Jukebox. Using a VAE, it learns musical features/genres in latent space, then produces new music retaining the original style while uniquely aligning with input labels, fueling novel creativity.
